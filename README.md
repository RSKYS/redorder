## Realm of the Red-Order

Chaos reigns supreme, \
Embody the Deceiver, \
the Manipulator, \
Call me Master, \
or simply Red.

The path to creating the extraordinary is never simple. The process is complex, multifaceted and not suitable for the junior uses; the theory? simple, BIG BANG. \
Red Order is where the rules are rewritten and the boundaries are pushed.
